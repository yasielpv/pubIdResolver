	=== Pub Id Resolver Gateway Plugin
	=================================


The Pub Id Resolver gateway plugin resolves individual articles, issues and galleys in the OJS
installation using the supplied public id register in OJS. It can be addressed
at the following URL pattern:

http://localhost/ojs/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/pubIdResolver/...

...where, of course, localhost is the local server name, ojs is the path
to the OJS 3.x installation, and myJournal is the path to a particular
journal.

The plugin must be enabled in order to respond to requests. To enable the
plugin, or ensure that it is sufficiently configured, log into the Journal
Manager's "System Plugins" page, find the Pub Ids Resolver Gateway Plugin under the
"Gateway Plugins" heading, and click "Enable".

The resolver accepts parameters after the given URL pattern in the following
formats:

http://.../[doi]
http://.../[urn]
http://.../[purl]
http://.../[ark]

...where [doi], [urn], [purl], and [ark] are string identifying the
public identifier of the desired content. For example:

ARK:
http://localhost/ojs/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/pubIdResolver/ark:/12345/fk12345

DOI:
http://localhost/ojs/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/pubIdResolver/10.12345/fk12345

Also, It can obtain the element metadata using the format ERC adding question marks at the end of the persistent identifier.
ERC format includes the metadata who, what, when, where, how and target. Who is the creator of the item, 
What is the name of the item, When is the publication date of the item, Where is the persistent URL of the item, 
How is the format of the item and Target is the final URL of the item that is appointed from the Where field. For example:

http://localhost/ojs/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/pubIdResolver/ark:/12345/fk12345?

obtaining this response:


erc:  
who: LAST NAME AUTHOR 1, FIRST NAME AUTHOR 1; LAST NAME AUTHOR 2, FIRST NAME AUTHOR 2
what: TITLE
when: DATE
where: ark:/12345/fk12345 (https://n2t.net/ark:/12345/fk12345)
how: (:mtype text) article
_t: http://localhost/myJournal/article/view/45
