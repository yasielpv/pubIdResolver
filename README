	=== Pub Ids Resolver Gateway Plugin
	=================================


The Pub Ids Resolver gateway plugin resolves individual articles, issues and galleys in the OJS
installation using the supplied public id register in OJS. It can be addressed
at the following URL pattern:

http://localhost/ojs/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/pubIdResolver/...

...where, of course, localhost is the local server name, ojs is the path
to the OJS 3.x installation, and myJournal is the path to a particular
journal.

The plugin must be enabled in order to respond to requests. To enable the
plugin, or ensure that it is sufficiently configured, log into the Journal
Manager's "System Plugins" page, find the Pub Ids Resolver Gateway Plugin under the
"Gateway Plugins" heading, and click "Enable".

The resolver accepts parameters after the given URL pattern in the following
formats:

http://.../[doi]
http://.../[urn]
http://.../[purl]
http://.../[ark]

...where [doi], [urn], [purl], and [ark] are string identifying the
public identifier of the desired content.

This plugin ships with current releases of OJS 3.x and the PKP support
team may be contacted for more information. See docs/README.md.
